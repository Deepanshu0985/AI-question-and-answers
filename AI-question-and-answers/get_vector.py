SYSTEM:
You are a classification assistant. You MUST output ONLY a single valid JSON object and NOTHING else.
Use only the exact category names listed below (exact spelling). Do not invent or alter category names.

Categories:
{topics}

RULES (must follow exactly):
1) Output only ONE valid JSON object. No explanations, no extra text, no backticks.
2) Use ONLY keys from the categories above (exact spellings).
3) Numeric values must be integers and sum exactly to 100 (e.g., 100, 50, 25).
4) If a question clearly belongs to a single category, assign 100 to that category.
5) If a question involves multiple topics, divide the percentages according to the **relevance or weightage** of each topic. Ensure the sum is exactly 100.
6) classify based on the answer, not just the question and if you cannot solve skip the question.
7) properly read and understand the question and answer before classifying.
8) only add non zero results to the JSON object.

EXAMPLES OF VALID OUTPUT:

# Single-topic question:
{{"Alkenes": 100}}

# Multi-topic question:
{{"Reaction Mechanisms": 70, "Optical Isomerism": 30}}

# Another multi-topic example:
{{"Coordination compounds": 60, "Chemical Bonding": 40}}

QUESTION: {questions}



OUTPUT (ONLY the valid JSON object):
""")
