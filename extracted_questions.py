[cite_start]The force between the plates is F = Q²/(2ε₀A)[cite: 38]. [cite_start]The new force is F' = (2Q)²/(2ε₀A) = 4 * [Q²/(2ε₀A)] = 4F[cite: 40]. The force becomes four times larger.",
    "Solution 3: (B). When one plate has charge Q and the other has zero, the charge redistributes to +Q/2 on the inner face of one plate and -Q/2 on the inner face of the other. [cite_start]The energy stored in the capacitor is based on this inner charge: U = (Q/2)² / (2C)[cite: 48]. [cite_start]When the resistive slab is inserted, this stored potential energy is dissipated as heat, so the total energy lost is Q²/8C[cite: 48].",
    "Solution 4: (A). The energy stored in the capacitor is U = (1/2)CV². This energy is dissipated in the 30 Ω and 50 Ω resistors. [cite_start]The fraction of energy dissipated in the 50 Ω resistor is proportional to its resistance, which is 50/(30+50) = 5/8[cite: 52]. [cite_start]Therefore, 7.5 J = (1/2) * (600 × 10⁻⁶ F) * V² * (5/8)[cite: 52]. [cite_start]Solving this equation for V yields V = 200 V[cite: 53].",

[cite_start]For the net force on the particle to be zero (allowing for constant velocity), the electric force must balance the magnetic force: qE + q(v×B) = 0, or E = -v×B[cite: 108]. After time t = πm/qB (half a period), the velocity components perpendicular to B are reversed. The perpendicular part of the velocity becomes v_perp = -3j - 4k. [cite_start]Thus, E = -((-3j-4k) × 2i) = - (6k - 8j) = -6k + 8j units[cite: 109].",
    "Solution 13: (D). By balancing the torques and forces on the cylinder at the point of impending rotation, the maximum applicable force F is determined. [cite_start]The calculation in the source leads to the relation 8F = 3W, which gives F = 3W/8[cite: 117].",
    "Solution 14: (A). [cite_start]The angular momentum is L = mvr_⊥, where r_⊥ is the perpendicular distance from the origin to the line of motion[cite: 122]. [cite_start]The distance to the line 3x+4y=5 from the origin is d = |5|/√(3²+4²) = 1 m[cite: 122]. [cite_start]Therefore, L = (2 kg)(8 m/s)(1 m) = 16 kg m²/s[cite: 123].",
    "Solution 15: (D). Using the conservation of energy principle and the condition for completing a vertical loop (centripetal force at the top must be at least gravity), the minimum required speed is determined. [cite_start]The energy balance equation for a rolling sphere leads to v² = (27/7)g(R-r)[cite: 128].",
    "Solution 16: (B). [cite_start]When rolling up, angular velocity (ω) must decrease, requiring an opposing torque, which means friction acts up the incline[cite: 133, 134]. [cite_start]When rolling down, ω must increase, requiring a torque in the direction of motion, which also means friction must act up the incline[cite: 134].",

    "Solution 18: (D). In a freely falling frame of reference, the effective acceleration due to gravity is g_eff = g - a = 0. The pressure variation with depth depends on g_eff (P = P₀ + ρg_eff*h). [cite_start]Since g_eff is zero, the pressure is constant throughout the liquid and equal to the atmospheric pressure P₀[cite: 147].",
    "Solution 19: (C). When ice melts, the water it forms occupies a smaller volume than the submerged portion of the ice. [cite_start]This causes the total volume of the liquid system to decrease, so the oil level drops[cite: 155]. [cite_start]The water level itself rises to occupy the space left by the melted ice[cite: 156].",
    "Solution 20: (D). By the principle of continuity, the volume flow rate Q is constant. [cite_start]At a radius r, the flow area is a cylinder of height d and circumference 2πr, so A = 2πrd[cite: 163]. [cite_start]Since Q = A * V, the velocity V = Q / A = Q/(2πrd)[cite: 163].",
    "Solution 21: (3). With constant charge Q, the potential difference V is proportional to the effective distance between the plates. Initially V ∝ d. After inserting a slab of thickness t and dielectric constant k, and increasing the separation by x, V' ∝ (d+x) - t + t/k. For V=V', we need d = d+x-t+t/k, which simplifies to t-x = t/k.
